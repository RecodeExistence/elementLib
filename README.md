This element lib is a start on my tool to automatically generate html elements just via 
a few simple commands.  

It's an effort to bring these create/addition tools under one set, and make them readily available. 

typing elementLib('p', 'class', 'elementname'); 

would give us a new paragraph like this:  

<p class = 'elementName'> Here is an awesome dynamically generated paragraph </p>
